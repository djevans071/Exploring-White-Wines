# Exploring White Wines

Exploratory data analysis of white wine dataset with R

In this project, we will be exploring what chemical and physical properties of white wines determine their qualiity. The `wines` dataset (found at [this link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityWhites.csv&sa=D&ust=1487113245445000&usg=AFQjCNGiTBcgJFA2RXpR9o5t2XQ1-pcnow) with the following [description](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt)) contains 12 variables with almost 5000 observations. The `X` column is a redundant index, so I do not count it as a unique variable.
